Introductory Repository

I graduated from the University of Houston with a B.S. in Computer Engineering Technology, and joined the company Avanade. I have a certifciation in Azure Fundamentals and UiPath Fundamentals. The current work project I am on, is working with a major bank working on data analytics where I analyze application progression. 
For extracurricular activities I rock climb, bike, and sew.
The technical training I am working on currently is growing skills in C# and .Net, and understanding software development more intimately.
